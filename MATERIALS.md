# Materials System

This system governs the properties of objects, allowing objects to interact with any object with a certain property.</br>
For example, fire should only burn flammable objects.</br>

Properties of an object are clear state changes, like "Aflame" or "Broken".</br>
Each property is bound to a [Systemic Variable](VARIABLES.md), and when that variable reaches a certain threshold, the property becomes active.</br>
When the variable no longer reaches the threshold, the property becomes inactive.</br>

## Properties
 - Aflame
 - Frozen
 - Electrified
 - Waterlogged (may change to "Soaked" with variables for various different fluids)
